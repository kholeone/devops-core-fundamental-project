### Brief
- To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

#### Additional Requirements
- A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion
on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.

- A relational database used to store data persistently for the
project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it.

- Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture
used for the project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.

- A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best
practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on
the Kanban Board

- Fully designed test suites for the application, as
well as automated tests for validation of the application. 
Providing high test coverage in the backend and provide consistent
reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

- A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.

- Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the
Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI
server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.


#### My Approach
To achieve this, I have decided to produce a simple listing app that must allow the user to do the following:
- Title the listing
- Provide a location 
- List a price
- Write a detailed description

- Read and update the listings (satisfies **Read** and **Update**.)
- Delete listings (satisfies **Delete**)

### Architecture
Here is an entity relationship diagram (ERD) that shows the construction of the database 
which has gone through many iterations to provide the most realistic and logical implementation in the app.

## Database Structure

Here is a Entity relationship diagram (ERD). This is the final database structure chosen to build with the application.
It is able to store all the information in the database, able to create, read, update and delete everything associated database.

### Testing 

### Front-End Design

The front-end design is relatively simple, it features the basics of text boxes, hyperlinks,
drop down menus, buttons and also a layout that provides ease of navigation.


### Known Issues

### Future Improvements

There are many improvements that can be made to the application
assuming having less time constraints and broadening of knowledge.
Improvements such as:

- Having a login for sellers that want to create a listing.
- Allow pictures to be uploaded to display the product.
- Have a messaging system where users can publically or privately message each other in regards of the listing.
- Have a stylistic front-end design to make the application more appealing
- Produce an application that was close to the original concept 
- To have an application with minimal bugs
